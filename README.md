After you have acceptet the assignment in GitHub Classroom, you will need to initialize it by importing the issues from the template.

- Open a GitHub CodeSpace 
- From the terminal run (from the repository root):
  ```
  .github/template/cpissues.sh
  ```

The command will create a series of issues in your own repo - simply get cracking at 'em - work those issues!
